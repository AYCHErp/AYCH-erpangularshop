SCIPIO ERP - Angular Shop

*****************
* G E N E R A L *
*****************
This is a variant of the original shop component, containing a complete angular product store. 

Please be aware that the component may receive frequent updates and due to the differences between the logic involved in the actual shop
and this component, it may neither be feature-complete nor bug-free. 

To get started, the following information may be of interest to you:

* Default load style sheets directory: 
  webapp/angular/css/
* SCIPIO will load a base set of class & html definitions located here:
  htmlVariables.groovy - ofbiz_foundation/framework/common/webcommon/includes/scipio/lib/standard
  
  These can be (and for the purpose of this theme will be) overriden in the following file:
  themeStyles.groovy

***************************
* I N S T A L L A T I O N *
***************************
If not already included with your copy, the theme can be manually installed into any Scipio repo and 
kept up to date by merging from a separate repository.
