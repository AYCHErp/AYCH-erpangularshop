# Angular Shop (Prototype)

##  General
This is a variant of the original shop component, containing a complete angular product store. 

This store is a *SHOW CASE* only and does not match the functionality of the original shop component.

Please be aware that the component may not receive updates and due to the differences between the logic involved in the actual shop
and this component, it may never be feature-complete nor bug-free.
